# ProfPage

A website template for academicians and researchers. The contents of the folder should be modified with the details of the user, and stored as a GitHub repository of the same name, replacing dumbledore's name by yours. Then you can share as a GitHub webpage. I use a similar template for my personal website, which you can find [here](https://anamitro.github.io).
